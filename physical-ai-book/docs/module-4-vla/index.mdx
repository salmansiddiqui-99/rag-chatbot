# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** systems represent the frontier of Physical AI—robots that understand natural language commands and translate them into physical actions.

**Example Interaction**:

```
Human: "Go to the kitchen and bring me the red cup from the counter"
Robot: [Navigates to kitchen] → [Detects red cup] → [Grasps cup] → [Returns]
```

This module teaches you to build VLA pipelines using:

- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text for voice commands
- **LLMs** (GPT-4, Claude): Natural language understanding and task planning
- **ROS 2 Actions**: Execution layer for physical skills

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:

- ✅ **Integrate Voice Input**: Use OpenAI Whisper for robust speech recognition
- ✅ **Implement LLM Planning**: Decompose complex commands into executable primitives
- ✅ **Build Action Primitives**: Navigate, grasp, manipulate, return
- ✅ **Create VLA Pipeline**: End-to-end system from voice to action

## Topics Covered

### [1. Voice-to-Action with Whisper](./01-whisper-voice.mdx)

Capture audio, transcribe with Whisper, and trigger robot actions.

**Key Concepts**: PyAudio, Whisper API, intent parsing, error handling

---

### [2. LLM Cognitive Planning](./02-llm-planning.mdx)

Use GPT-4 to decompose tasks into step-by-step plans with error recovery.

**Key Concepts**: Prompt engineering, function calling, ReAct pattern, memory

---

### [3. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Project](./03-capstone-project.mdx)

Integrate all modules into a voice-controlled humanoid that navigates, perceives, and manipulates.

**Key Concepts**: System integration, multi-modal fusion, evaluation metrics

---

## Prerequisites

- **Modules 1-3 Complete**: ROS 2, simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, Nav2
- **OpenAI API Key** (Optional): For GPT-4 planning ($0.03/1K tokens)
- **Microphone**: USB mic or built-in laptop mic

---

## Estimated Time

**10-12 hours** over 3 weeks

---

## Hardware Requirements

- Same as previous modules
- **Microphone** for voice input
- **API Credits** (optional): $5-10 for OpenAI API testing

---

## Real-World Context

- **Google RT-2**: Vision-language-action model trained on 13 robot embodiments
- **Figure 01 + OpenAI**: Humanoid using multimodal GPT-4V for manipulation
- **1X NEO**: Voice-controlled home assistant humanoid

---

## Capstone Project Preview

**Autonomous Voice-Controlled Humanoid**:

- "Bring me the blue box from the shelf"
- End-to-end execution with recovery behaviors
- Evaluation: Success rate, execution time, error handling
