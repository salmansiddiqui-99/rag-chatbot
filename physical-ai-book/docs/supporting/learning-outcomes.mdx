# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

## 1. Design and Deploy ROS 2 Systems

Build distributed robotic systems using ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions for real-time control of humanoid robots.

**Skills Acquired**:

- Create publishers and subscribers for sensor data streaming
- Implement services for request-response patterns (path planning, IK)
- Use actions for long-running tasks (navigation, grasping)
- Debug distributed systems with ROS 2 CLI tools

**Assessments**: Project 1 (ROS 2 Architecture), Weekly Labs 1-3

---

## 2. Create Digital Twin Simulations

Develop high-fidelity physics simulations in Gazebo and Unity for sensor testing, motion planning, and visualization.

**Skills Acquired**:

- Configure physics engines (ODE, DART) for stable humanoid simulation
- Integrate virtual sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) with realistic noise models
- Build Gazebo worlds with obstacles and dynamic objects
- Render photorealistic scenes in Unity with HDRP

**Assessments**: Project 2 (Gazebo Humanoid Simulation), Weekly Labs 4-6

---

## 3. Integrate AI-Powered Navigation

Implement NVIDIA Isaac ROS modules for VSLAM, synthetic data generation, and bipedal navigation using Nav2.

**Skills Acquired**:

- Generate synthetic training datasets with Isaac Sim and Replicator
- Deploy GPU-accelerated visual SLAM on NVIDIA Jetson hardware
- Adapt Nav2 costmaps and planners for humanoid footstep planning
- Implement Zero Moment Point (ZMP) stability checks

**Assessments**: Project 3 (Isaac VSLAM Integration), Weekly Labs 7-10

---

## 4. Build Vision-Language-Action Systems

Combine voice input (Whisper), LLM reasoning (GPT-4), and robotic action execution for autonomous task planning.

**Skills Acquired**:

- Integrate OpenAI Whisper for robust speech-to-text
- Use LLMs for task decomposition and error recovery
- Implement ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) patterns
- Build end-to-end voice-controlled autonomous systems

**Assessments**: Capstone Project (Autonomous Humanoid), Weekly Labs 11-13

---

## 5. Optimize Robot Perception Systems

Configure and tune LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU sensors for reliable environmental perception in dynamic settings.

**Skills Acquired**:

- Calibrate sensor intrinsics and extrinsics
- Implement sensor fusion (LiDAR + IMU + vision)
- Handle sensor noise, occlusions, and environmental variations
- Optimize perception pipelines for real-time performance (&lt;50ms latency)

**Assessments**: All hands-on labs, sensor calibration assignments

---

## 6. Deploy Production-Ready Robotics Software

Containerize, version, and deploy robotic applications using Docker, Git, and CI/CD best practices.

**Skills Acquired**:

- Structure ROS 2 packages following best practices
- Use Git for version control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Write unit tests and integration tests for robot nodes
- Document code with clear README, API docs, and architecture diagrams

**Assessments**: Code reviews, deployment assignments, capstone submission

---
